<h1>About me</h1>
<div class="div2">
<p>This is a web page I did for my WEB105 class. I did this to honor Valentine's Day, and my recently established
relationship with my girlfriend Hayley. She likes gaming, food, Murder Drones, and other pop culture stuff. I like
similar stuff as her. We are very happy together. We attend the same community college and we first met in the
Neurodivergent Club. We went out on a date at Woodstock Square at one point too, and we talked quite a bit! We have a
bright future ahead of us! So yeah, that's it and that's all! :)</p>
